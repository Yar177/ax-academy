- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Students use multiple strategies (count-on, make ten, doubles) to solve within 20.
  - Students interpret and create true/false equations to reason about equality.
  - Students identify unknown partners in equations (e.g., 8 + __ = 11).
- **Prerequisites:** Kindergarten fluency within 5, knowledge of number bonds to 10, ability to represent problems with drawings.
- **Remediation Hooks:** Strategy sort cards, fact family triangles, and adaptive fact fluency sprints with spaced repetition.

### Number & Operations in Base Ten (NY-NGMLS: 1.NBT.1-1.NBT.6)
- **K5 Learning Practice Strand:** Place Value & Number Sense
- **Focus Topics:** Counting to 120, understanding place value to the tens place, comparing two-digit numbers, understanding 10 as a bundle of ten ones, adding within 100 using place value strategies.
- **Learning Objectives:**
  - Students read, write, and represent numbers to 120 in standard, expanded, and model forms.
  - Students compare two-digit numbers using >, =, < symbols based on place value reasoning.
  - Students add and subtract multiples of 10 within 100 mentally.
- **Prerequisites:** Mastery of teen numbers, ability to group objects into tens and ones, familiarity with comparing numbers to 20.
- **Remediation Hooks:** Place value disks, number line jumps with scaffolding, and "build-draw-write" routines for two-digit numbers.

### Measurement & Data (NY-NGMLS: 1.MD.1-1.MD.4)
- **K5 Learning Practice Strand:** Measurement & Data
